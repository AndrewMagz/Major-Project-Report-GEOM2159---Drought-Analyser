# Major-Project-Report-GEOM2159---Drought-Analyser
Created by s3603187, this repository was created as apart of the Major Project Report for GIS Programming (GEOM2159).  The major project required students to write a plan and program using python code, and as shown in the repository, I have chosen to program a drought analyzing program.
